# Les Joies de SUPINFO
Welcome to the public repository for Les Joies de SUPINFO project!

This project is based on Symfony2. But at first, we wrote it in vanilla PHP :
you can check the original sources (in the `vanilla-php` branch), but it is neither used nor maintained anymore.

If you want to contribute, here's how!

## Contribute
